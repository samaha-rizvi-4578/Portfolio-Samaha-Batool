# My personal Portfolio webiste
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This space showcases my web development projects and my journey in this exciting field.

> **Note:** While I primarily work as a backend developer, I ventured into frontend development to create this portfolio. I followed a reference video and added my unique styles and vibes to make it my own.

## Credits
A huge shoutout to this amazing creator whose portfolio served as a blueprint for mine: [Watch the reference video](https://youtu.be/f_ZxgQQ74Lc).
